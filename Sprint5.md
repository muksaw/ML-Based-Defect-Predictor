   - Added new testing methodologies from course material
   - Introduced more logic coverage for bug detection

## Technical Improvements

1. **CSV Export System**:
   ```python
   # Enhanced file naming for better organization
   timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
   analysis_type = 'historical' if historical_data else 'prediction'
   csv_path = os.path.join(output_dir, 
                          f'feature_table_{analysis_type}_{timestamp}.csv')
   df.to_csv(csv_path, index=False)
   ```

2. **Enhanced Logic Coverage**:
   ```python
   def is_bug_fix(self, commit_msg):
       return any(keyword in commit_msg.lower() for keyword in [
           'fix', 'bug', 'issue', 'error', 'crash', 'problem',
           'defect', 'fault', 'flaw', 'incorrect', 'regression'
       ])
   ```

3. **Output Organization**:
   ```python
   # More descriptive output filename with timestamp and run configuration
   config_info = []
   if args.train:
       config_info.append('train')
   if args.predict:
       config_info.append('predict')
   if args.load_model:
       config_info.append('loaded_model')
   
   run_type = '_'.join(config_info) if config_info else 'analysis'
   output_file = os.path.join(OUTPUTS_DIR, 
                             f"{output_base}_{run_type}_{timestamp}.txt")
   ```

## Integration of Course Concepts

1. **Test Automation (Theme 1)**:
   - Automated execution through command-line interface:
     ```python
     parser.add_argument('--train', action='store_true', help='Train the model')
     parser.add_argument('--predict', action='store_true', help='Generate predictions')
     parser.add_argument('--save-model', action='store_true', help='Save the trained model')
     ```
   - Configurable parameters for different test scenarios
   - Continuous output logging and result tracking

2. **Test Design (Theme 2)**:
   - Systematic approach to feature extraction
   - Well-defined metrics for risk assessment:
     ```python
     def calculate_relative_risk(self, file_metrics):
         # Systematic risk assessment using multiple metrics
         commit_counts = [m['n_commits'] for m in file_metrics.values()]
         bug_fix_counts = [m['bug_fix_count'] for m in file_metrics.values()]
     ```
   - Coverage of different aspects of code quality

3. **Test Generation (Theme 3)**:
   - Automatic generation of test requirements through commit analysis
   - Feature extraction from repository history
   - Dynamic threshold adaptation

4. **Logic Coverage**:
   - Enhanced bug detection logic with comprehensive criteria
   - Improved pattern matching for defect identification
   - Systematic approach to categorizing code changes

## Challenges Addressed

1. **Output Organization**:
   - Previous: Output files lacked clear identification
   - Solution: Implemented descriptive naming with timestamps and analysis types
   - Result: Better traceability and organization of analysis results

2. **ML Framework Decision**:
   - Challenge: Evaluate potential switch to AutoGluon
   - Analysis: Found significant performance overhead
   - Decision: Maintained current implementation for better efficiency
   - Result: Preserved optimized performance while meeting course objectives

## Plans for Future Enhancements

**Regression Testing Integration**:
   - Implement incremental analysis capabilities
   - Focus analysis on recently modified files
   - Optimize performance for large codebases
   - Add change-based prediction refinement

## Conclusion

Sprint 5 has successfully integrated core software testing concepts while maintaining the project's practical utility. The addition of CSV export functionality and enhanced logic coverage demonstrates our application of course concepts, while the decision to maintain our current ML implementation shows pragmatic engineering judgment.

The improvements in output organization and feature extraction continue to enhance the tool's usability, while the integration of software testing principles strengthens its theoretical foundation. Moving forward, the planned implementations of graph coverage and regression testing concepts will further align the project with course objectives while maintaining its practical value for defect prediction.

Our enhanced model now provides:
- Better organized and more traceable outputs
- Stronger integration with software testing principles
- Maintained high performance and accuracy
- Clear path for future enhancements

These improvements position the tool as both a practical defect prediction system and a demonstration of core software testing concepts.
