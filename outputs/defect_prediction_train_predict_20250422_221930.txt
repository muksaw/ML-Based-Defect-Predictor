Total files analyzed: 7
Files predicted as buggy: 7
Files predicted as clean: 0

=== Risk Category Breakdown ===
Low Risk: 4 files (57.1%)
Medium-Low Risk: 2 files (28.6%)
Medium-High Risk: 1 files (14.3%)

=== Understanding the Metrics ===

* Confidence Score (0-1):
  This is the machine learning model's prediction confidence that a file contains bugs.
  - 0.5-0.7: Low confidence - the file might contain bugs
  - 0.7-0.85: Medium confidence - the file likely contains bugs
  - 0.85-1.0: High confidence - the file very likely contains bugs

* Confidence Threshold Adjustment:
  Base threshold: 0.70
  Adjusted threshold: 0.85
  This adjustment accounts for the 545 day analysis period.
  - Longer time periods use higher thresholds to reduce false positives
  - Only files with confidence above this threshold are shown

* Relative Risk Score:
  This normalized metric compares each file's risk against repository averages.
  Relative Risk considers bug history, commit patterns, and code complexity.
  - <0.5: Low Risk - significantly safer than repository average
  - 0.5-1.0: Medium-Low Risk - somewhat safer than repository average
  - 1.0-1.5: Medium Risk - around repository average
  - 1.5-3.0: Medium-High Risk - higher risk than repository average
  - >3.0: High Risk - significantly higher risk than repository average

=== Feature Table Export ===
A CSV file containing all extracted features has been saved to the outputs directory.
This table includes metrics such as:
  - Number of commits
  - Lines added/deleted
  - Code complexity
  - Bug fix history
  - Time-based metrics
You can use this data for further analysis or with other ML tools.
